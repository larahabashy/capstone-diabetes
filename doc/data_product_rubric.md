# Proposed data product grading scheme

Find below the breakdown for grading the final data product. The data product comprises 38% of the final course grade.

- (55%) Notebooks and Scripts
  - (10%) High-level documentation and structure for the project. Can a newcomer easily navigate your work and pick up from where you left off without having to do thorough detective work on your repo?
  - (10%) Low-level documentation. Can a newcomer read your notebooks and scripts and know what's happening? Is your logic clear and your code readable and commented where appropriate? Do your functions/classes have docstrings and are your scripts interpretable?
  - (25%) Code usability/quality. The usual code quality rubric.
  - (10%) Reproducibility. Do your notebooks/scripts run from top to bottom without throwing (unintended) errors? Have you managed your environments? Are their basic tests that validate the core functionality of the data product (e.g., load model weights, make a prediction, etc.)
- (30%) Deployed Data Product
  - (20%) Have the above notebooks and scripts been turned into an effective and well-designed product for both a technical and non-technical audience?
  - (5%) Can the product be easily modified and/or re-deployed if necessary (by someone with the requisite skill set).
  - (5%) Does the product include some high-level documentation about how to use it?
- (10%) Github Repository
  - Repository is well organised and easy to navigate.
  - Contains high-level documentation as necessary. Can a newcomer to the partner's organisation understand and navigate the contents of your repo?
  - Issues have been well utilised to track problems, tasks, and discussion about the project. They act as a useful source of documentation and project history.
- (5%) Future Work
  - Is the work provided easy to modify and improve in future?
  - The work hints at or provides avenues for such improvements (e.g., this may include the use of optional arguments in functions/classes, text in notebooks, in-line code comments, text in the GitHub README, etc.)
